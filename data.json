{"sightings":[{"text":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light. Was looking out my window and saw a orange colored, non blinking light floating across the night sky. Woke up my daughters to confirm what I was seeing. The object did not blink, was definitely not a helicopter. Very bright orange and moved slowly for about 2 minutes, disappeared behind the trees and did not see it again. Never seen anything like this in my life.","date_time":"2021-06-10","city":"Black Mountain","state":"NC","shape":"Fireball","duration":"2","summary":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light.

I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","date_time":"2021-08-05","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Sphere","duration":"3","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin","date":""},{"text":"dddddddddddddddddddd","date_time":"2021-08-15","city":"New Orleans","state":"Louisiana","shape":"Cigar","duration":"15","summary":"It was really big, like super big","date":""}]}
